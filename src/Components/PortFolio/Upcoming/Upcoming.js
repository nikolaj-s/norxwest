                I am currently working on 2 large projects at the moment.  
                First is called Can I Run It, this a site a user can go to put 
                in the game they want to run alongside their pc specs, and with 
                the power of web scraping return a youtube video of the game running on 
                similar or exact specs, possible fps, game reviews, and calculate if the user 
                is able to run it.  The second project I am working on is a React Native port of 
                The Bubble Network to bring to the Apple and Google play store
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
